        <h2>Our Mission:</h2>
        <p>Community Uplift Partnership (CUP), the Reunion Coffee Shop Operator, works to break the cycle of poverty through education and relationship. CUP provides job preparedness classes and paid hands-on-job training at Reunion Coffee House.
            Apprentice graduates will have identified their unique gifts and purpose, mastered the skills necessary to achieve their
            employment goals and will become leaders in their community.</p>

    <div id="history">
        <h2>Our History:</h2>
        <p>We proudly opened our doors in September 2018 with a mission to support young adults and create a welcoming, safe space for everyone. Thanks to the generous partnerships of Oakwood Homes and Boyer’s Coffee, we launched our first location, Reunion Coffee House. Since then, we've developed a comprehensive young adult program designed to empower youth on their journey to becoming successful adults. Today, with four locations and plans to continue expanding, we remain dedicated to offering support across Colorado.</p>

        <h2>Our Coffee:</h2>
        <p>Colorado's very own Boyer's Coffee was instrumental in helping our coffee house launch. We proudly serve Boyer’s premium coffee, delicious chai from Charlie Joe Chai, pastries from Blue Point Bakery and Sweet Savour Cakery, salads and sandwiches from Share Good Foods, and burritos from Lorenzo's and Santiago's!</p>
